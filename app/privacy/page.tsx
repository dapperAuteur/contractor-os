        <Section title="1. Who We Are">
          <p>
            CentenarianOS (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; &quot;our&quot;) is a longevity and health education platform operated by
            B4C LLC and AwesomeWebStore.com, founded by Anthony McDonald. This Privacy Policy explains
            how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information.

          <h3 className="font-medium text-gray-100 mt-4 mb-1">Health &amp; Metrics Data</h3>
          <p>
            If you choose to use the Metrics features, we collect daily health data you enter manually,
            including: resting heart rate, step count, sleep hours, activity minutes, and optional
            enrichment metrics (HRV, SpO2, sleep score, stress score, recovery score, active calories).
            Body weight tracking requires explicit opt-in acknowledgment.

          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>This data is private by default.</strong> It is never sold. Your public profile
            shows only aggregate summaries (e.g., day-logging streak count), never raw metric values.
