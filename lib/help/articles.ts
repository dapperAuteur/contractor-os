Green NCV means high nutrient density — lots of protein and fiber for the calories (e.g., salmon with vegetables). Yellow means balanced macros. Red means calorie-dense with lower protein and fiber (e.g., pastries or heavy sauces). NCV helps you see at a glance whether a meal is optimized for longevity nutrition.
