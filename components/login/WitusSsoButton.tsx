// File: components/login/WitusSsoButton.tsx
// "Sign in with WitUS", plus the silent "Continue as <name>" check on top of it.
//
// WHAT THE VISITOR SEES. The login form is already on screen; nothing here delays it. The button
// says "Sign in with WitUS" from the first paint. If the probe comes back with a live WitUS session
// it becomes "Continue as <name>". If the probe fails, times out, is blocked by the browser's
// third-party-cookie rules, or the IdP does not answer, NOTHING changes and NOTHING is said. A
// failed silent check must be completely invisible: no error, no spinner, no layout shift.
//
// THE GATES. `enabled` and `appOrigin` are resolved on the SERVER (lib/auth/witus-sso-server.ts) and
// handed down through WitusSsoProvider. Unconfigured means this renders null — the divider included
// — rather than offering a button whose click lands on /login?error=witus_not_configured. The
// origin check keeps it off www.badcba.com, the other host this one deployment serves, where the
// IdP knows neither the redirect URI nor the origin and every leg of the flow would fail.
//
// Clicking runs the app's real OIDC code flow at /api/auth/witus/authorize. The name on the button
// grants nothing.
